Educate Me

This application is to be used as a bank of resources used to learn various 
technologies and subjects. You are able to signup for a profile where you are  able to 
add resources you are using the learn technologies. Soon you will be able to review the 
resource and if it was good recommend it to others. With so many different ways to learn 
specific technologies this will be a way to filter out the less useful ones and focus on 
only the best material. This application is using Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap and jQuery.
